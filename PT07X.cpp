// BPM approach
// tree is a bipartite graph, so the minimum vertex cover is
// equivalent to the maximum flow (KÃ¶nig's theorem). first run a DFS
// to determine the color of each node, then add 2 extra nodes
// (the source and the sink), connect the source to all black nodes,
// the sink to all white nodes and set all edges' capacities to 1.
// Finally, perform a maximum flow algorithm and you're done.

// DP approach is similar to greedy approach
// dp[i][1] = answer of problem rooted at node i if node i is included in set
// dp[i][0] = answer of problem rooted at node i if node i is not included in set

// dp[i][1] = 1 + (sum(min(dp[v][0], dp[v][1]))) where v is children of i
// dp[i][0] = sum(dp[v][1]) where v is children of i
// in first case no need to select all children, hence take min,
// in second case have to select all children
// final answer is min(dp[1][0], dp[1][1])

// pretty awesome greedy approach - two steps:
// 1) for all leaves, include parents in min vertexcover
// (this holds because in min vertexcover which includes leaves,
// replace leaves with parents, cardinatlity of min vertexcover remains same)
// 2) for all internal nodes, if any child is not included in min vertexcover,
// include this node in it - use DFS approach to visit all children before taking
// decision for current node - why this works? after step 1), remove all edges and
// vertices covered by min vertexcover of step 1, now reapply same argument of step 1)
// - basically, induction from bottom of the tree
