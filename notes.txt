ajay somani's notes on TC
Modular exponentiation and modular multiplication
Concept is quite interesting
modexp - multiply the base by itself, then multiply earlier product with itself, etc. if odd, multiply by base.
modmul - multiply by two, then multiply earlier product with itself
if odd, add in final step.
problems may involve matrix exponentiation - do it on matrix ops now

Some facts on euler's totient function from TC tutorials again
For prime p, for phi(a*p) or phi(a^p), etc.
